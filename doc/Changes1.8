  - Replaced most dns.mod preprocessor definitions with config variables.
  - Added support for user-specified dns servers and non-standard ports.
    This is most important for Cygwin 1.7, where the dns server list won't
    get initialized under some common conditions.
  - Added a trace to the new variable dns-servers, allowing scripts to get
    or set the current dns server list.
  - Added the servers list to the dns module information displayed by
    .status all

  - Fixed a bug in setsockname() making it fail with IPv6 enabled due to a
    variable not being set.

  - Fix env(TZ) config setting to not contain a space. The space is just
    inserted in POSIX documentation to clarify, it must not be there.

  - Made dcc_telnet_new() allow non-latin characters in new handles like
    other handle validation functions.
    Patch by: pseudo

  - Modified src/compat/ replacements of gethostbyname2() and inet_ntop()
    to not compile when IPv6 is disabled.
  - Added a missing header preventing gethostbyname2() from compiling on
    FreeBSD.
  - Fixed few lines with wrong indentation.
    Patch by: pseudo

  - Reran autotools.
  - Added detection of Tcl_NotifierProcs members to ensure the notifier can
    be replaced. Fixes compilation against Tcl 8.2 and 8.3.

  - Added full IPv6 support. New patch, nothing in common with older ones.
  - Changed a lot of functions and variables without breaking scripting
    compatibility. The list of changes is too long to include here.
