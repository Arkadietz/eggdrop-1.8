Eggdrop Changes (since version 1.8.0)

    _____________________________________________________________________

1.8.0 (CVS):

    inserted in POSIX documentation to clarify, it must not be there.

  - Made dcc_telnet_new() allow non-latin characters in new handles like
    other handle validation functions.

    FreeBSD.
  - Fixed few lines with wrong indentation.
