    are now available using ssl.
    Patch by: guppy

    This is most important for Cygwin 1.7, where the dns server list won't
    get initialized under some common conditions.

    or set the current dns server list.
  - Added the servers list to the dns module information displayed by
    .status all

    variable not being set.

    inserted in POSIX documentation to clarify, it must not be there.

  - Made dcc_telnet_new() allow non-latin characters in new handles like
    other handle validation functions.
    Patch by: pseudo

  - Modified src/compat/ replacements of gethostbyname2() and inet_ntop()
    to not compile when IPv6 is disabled.
